# iplist
We base our collection on a list of IPs that provide abuse for firewalls and mail systems
The IP list range for mail system abuse. We collect according to the abuse IP we actually encounter, and support IPv4 and IPv6. Usually, the minimum range of ipv4 is /24, and IPv6 /48 If according to our judgment, we will carry out a larger range .For example, the IP range of some large operators in China. /16 Because they are usually used for dynamic users, they are not controlled.
